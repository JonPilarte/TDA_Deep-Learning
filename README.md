# Thesis project collaboration in Image Recognition for predicting Alzheimer using eye images
• Created a patented Binary Classifier through training with a real patient database <br />
• Improved accuracy up to 80% by implementing Topological Data Analysis image processing <br />
• Explored the potential for a hybrid merge, combining GLCM and TDA methodologies <br />
